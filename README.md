# Artificial-intelligence-RNN-architecture....RMSE-
The dataset (TS_data_HW_18F.csv) on the Canvas contains various measurements (i.e. snow  , temp.   , etc) from a power plant for about 10 years. The last column is th  e power generated on each day. Write a program using either MatLab or a ny programming language of your choice to  perform a regression an alysis on this dataset using the RNN/LSTM/GRU approach. More specifically, train your RNN by setting your sequence lengt   h = 30.Answer the following questions:1.Include a WORD document to describe your RNN architecture.2.Describe your sequence training steps in detail.3.Use the last 30-day data as test data. What is the total    RMSE on your test data?Please make sure that you clearly describe how to interpret your RMSE.4.Create a figure that plots the test data and your prediction.5.Create another figure that plots the RMSE over time.
